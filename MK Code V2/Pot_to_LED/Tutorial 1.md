Potentiometer to LED
===========

# Introduction
This series of tutorials focuses on demonstrating the power of system thinking. We will start with the Potentiometer --> Arduino --> LED system you have seen in the beginning class. We will then switch out the inputs and the outputs and then change the code to adpat the input to the output. Throughout this whole series the system will have the same behavior. This is the input will control the blink rate of the output. To begin with we will go thorugh the code you have seen before. This tutorial will focus on how the code is organized and how to see what the code is doing while it is running.
